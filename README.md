## Expected Workflow:
1. The user opens the app, and there will be only one button: "Add Widget".
2. When the user clicks the "Add Widget" button, a new popup or screen will appear with three options: "Textbox," "Imagebox," and "Save Button."
3. The user should be able to select and add one or multiple options at a time.
4. If the user only adds the "Save Button" widget to the home page, then the button will appear on the home page, but if the user clicks on the "Save Button" on the home page, then it will not work, and it will give an error: "Add at-least a widget to save."
5. If the user selects at least one widget between "Textbox" and "Imagebox," along with the "Save Button" widget, and adds that to the home page, then the user will be able to save data (Image and Text or both) to the firebase database by clicking on the "Save Button" on the home page. After saving the data on Firebase, it should update "Textbox" and "Imagebox" with the newly saved data.
